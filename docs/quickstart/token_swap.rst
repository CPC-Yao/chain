Token Swap
==================

You can swap your ERC20 CPC Tokens
from Ethereum blockchain to CPChain Mainnet by either of the following methods.


Using CPC Wallet
----------------------

1. Click the "**Import Wallet**" button in CPC Wallet app,
to import the wallet that holds ERC20 CPC tokens.
Make sure that the imported wallet address is consistent with
original ERC20 CPC Token wallet address.

    You can import wallet by **private key** or **keystore**.
    Note that the token swap only supports wallets using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)*.


    *: The majority of main stream wallets adopt ECDSA as their digital signature algorithm.

2. Transfer ERC20 CPC Tokens from your
wallet to the following burn address:

        Ox11111111

    The CPChain Foundation is constantly overseeing the burn address.
    After receiving tokens in 48 hours,
    Mainnet CPC tokens of the same value will be transfered to the imported wallet.
    Tokens in the burn address are going to be burned.
