Mapping
=============

CPC wallet mapping is to transfer CPC tokens from Ethereum blockchain
to CPChain Mainnet.


Steps
---------


1. Each user sends a certain amount of CPC tokens from his/her Ethereum wallet to a predefined address.
#. This user stores the hash of the transaction, and submit in the wallet/website.
#. CPChain Foundation acknowledges and affirms this transfer according to the transaction hash.
#. CPChain Foundation transfers CPC tokens of the same value in CPChain Mainnet.
