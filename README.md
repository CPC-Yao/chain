IoT is having a profound and unprecedented impact on human society. However, without trust, it is no
more than a castle built on sand. You share the benefits, but with your privacy and financial safety
as the cost.


For us, **trust** is of utmost concern. **The mission of cpchain is to build a vital IoT ecosystem
which is secured by the blockchain technology.** Everyone can enjoy the convenience of M2M
payment, self-driving, wearable monitoring, etc. to the fullest extent without worry.


We are shaping a trusted future with blockchain, from smart home to smart city, from edge to cloud
computing, with you and with everyone! Please come and join us.
